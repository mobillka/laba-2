  <div id="block-4"><p>Once upon a time, a tiny cat named Whiskers spotted a bright butterfly fluttering by her garden. Curious, she chased it through the flowers, pouncing and missing every time. The butterfly finally landed on her nose, and they shared a moment of stillness. From that day on, Whiskers and the butterfly played together, fluttering and leaping in the garden every sunny afternoon. They were the best of friends.</p></div>
